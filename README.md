# E-shop_Prototype

"Monica Vinar" (fictional name) javascript e-shop without any real functionality.

Hello everyone,

This project does not contain any real functionality, as you can see it is more of a web design (however, this also was not the main part I've focused on during this project). This e-shop was created using javascript, css and html. I've tried to use some new (at least for me) methodologies in practice. 
The main reason I've decided to upload the “Monica Vinar” project on GitHub is to learn more about this platform and hopefully get some helpful feedback. All of the libraries and other sources I've used on the “Monica Vinar” project are noted in the footer section. 
Kindly note, that “Monica Vinar” is one of my biggest projects thus far, so hopefully you enjoy. 
Thank you for your time!
